Query Optimization Course

## Quickstart

 1. Run `make` to compile the source code.
 2. Run `make db` to create a sample database inside the `data` directory.

## Exercise 1

The source code is located in `exercises/ex01`. Execute the code using `bin/ex01-query1` and
`bin/ex01-query2`.

The second part of the exercise can be found in `src` (especially `src/parser`); execute it using `bin/query`.
